    </h1>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Where to find funding</h2>
    

    <p>As well as using the <a href="start">find funding for natural flood management service</a>, you should also speak to your Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) and your Local Authority. They may be able to help you with your project.</p>

  


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Writing a successful application</h2>

    <p>Successful applicants for natural flood management funding tend to make sure their application is focused on the funder's aims and objectives. All applications should be tailored to the body that is awarding the funding. Generic applications are often not successful.</p>
    <p>You may also want to consider building other benefits (as well as flood reduction) into your project.</p> 
    <p>Projects that have a range of environmental and social benefits are often able to access funding more easily. These benefits could include:
